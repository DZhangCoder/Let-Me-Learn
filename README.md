### App Description
Let Me Learn is a secure platform and place where those who want to learn and those willing to teach can meet. 
- Want to learn how to golf or cook or code? Make a post to see if anyone is willing to teach you, or browse our list of teachers in your desired area of learning!
- Good at something and want to teach and make the world a better place? Create a profile with what qualifies you as a “teacher” and your availability, then start searching through posts to find your student!

Both teachers and students will have a rating/review of how their experience was with the other individual.

### Motivation for Creation 
We all have things in life that we would like to be better at that don’t really have the most traditional ways of being taught and/or you don’t want to take actual classes that are expensive or you don’t have time for. (example: skateboarding, organizational skills, how to build a bookshelf.)

### Future Development 
We are looking to develop the following aspects of our app in the future: 

- Build two seperate user terminals for students and teachers
- When an agreement is reached between a pair, they can book an appointment using calendly on our app 
- For safety reasons, we need to monitor the conversation between pairs. So we may need to build a built-in chat box and require mandatory usage. We may also need a screening procedure. 
- We haven’t developed a business model for our app. Our initial idea is to either have a bidding system for the skills or to have a “trading” system where users can trade their skills. 
- Both teachers and students will have a rating/review of how their experience was with the other individual.
